Neighborhood Watch is a neighborhood app tailored for a specific neighborhood. Users may take on either of the two user roles, i.e occupant or administrator.

The roles of the administrator involve: adding occupants, adding amenities and general oversight of neighborhood activities. An occupant is able to make a post visible to the neighborhood and also add a business they think would interest other occupants.
